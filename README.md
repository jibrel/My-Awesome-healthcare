# EHR

1. [Bahnmi](https://www.bahmni.org/) Bahnmi is an open source her and dicom project, it includes openMRS Openelis, Odoo, dcm4chee.
2. [OpenMRS](https://openmrs.org/) one of the best open source ehr projects and growing.
3. [Care2x](http://www.care2x.org/) This is one of the oldest and inspiring project in open source EHR eco-system, probably as many open source projects going downhill without any maintenance and support, so sad. I love care2x.
4. [Hospital run](https://hospitalrun.io/) is a new comer and is supported by openJS foundation, announced for in hacktoberfest by Digital Ocean, based on Node.js and couchdb database its is basic and simple to run. 
5. [Libre EHR](https://librehealth.io/projects/lh-ehr/) The LibreHealth EHR application is a clinically-focused electronic health record (EHR) system designed to be both easy to use “out of the box” and also customizable for use in a variety of health care settings. It builds on the strength of the LibreHealth Toolkit, and adapts many of the proven user experiences built over many years with **OpenEMR**. It is designed to be a modern, easy-to-use experience for health care professionals in their daily work. It Has a powerful REST API and DICOM connection.
6. [Open EMR](https://www.open-emr.org/) OpenEMR is the most popular open source electronic health records and medical practice management solution. OpenEMR's goal is a superior alternative to its proprietary counterparts with passionate volunteers and contributors dedicated to guarding OpenEMR's status as a free, open source software solution for medical practices with a commitment to openness, kindness and cooperation.
7. [Hospital Run](https://hospitalrun.io/) HospitalRun is designed to allow records to be carried to remote clinics. It works when there is no Internet, and syncs when there is. For the Developing World. HospitalRun is built to provide the most modern hospital information system possible to the least resourced environments. [Why Hospital Run!](https://hospitalrun.io/blog/why-hospitalrun/)
8. [Ripple Foundation](https://ripple.foundation/) Ripple Foundation is a not for profit foundation that has supported open source, open standards and an open architecture/platform for healthcare that can be re-used worldwide. The Ripple Foundation believes in the importance of an open, collaborative effort to addressing the key challenges we all face- we hope our efforts are useful to others – including those who share these values and want to further this mission. Ripple Foundation has 3 open source projects a UX/UI [Pulse Tile](https://www.pulsetile.com/), and A PostgreSQL based Database [EtherCIS](http://ethercis.org/), and finally a Node.js/Koa Based framework acting as middleware between front and back end serving REST API and Graphql [QEWD.js](https://www.qewdjs.com/). **Rob Tweed** is an active contributor  in these projects and has many online courses about MUMPS/Cache with Node.js check his website [M Gateway](http://ec2.mgateway.com/ewd/ws/index.html) or his Github or twitter account.
9. [EHR Base](https://ehrbase.org/) From a technical perspective, EHRbase is an open source software backend for clinical application systems and electronic health records. It is mainly based on the openEHR specifications, an open platform architecture for developing flexible and interoperable eHealth systems. Applications based on openEHR share a common information architecture, i.e. they „speak“ the same technical language to express clinical information. This enables interoperability between applications by design. EHRbase is also a community that aims to bring down barriers for vendors, hospitals, regional and national eHealth programs, researchers and others to adapt open standards and thereby foster the establishment of semantic interoperability. As an alternative to proprietary platform products or self-development, EHRbase strives to give organizations a modern, standard-compliant and bedrock-solid foundation for their mission critical business operations and their next generation eHealth solutions.
10. [Open Source Healthcare](https://opensourcehealthcare.org/) I love the open source healthcare initiative. 
		Healthcare is too important to be closed.
		We have open standards
		for finance,

	because we value our money more than our health.

	We have open standards
	for transportation

	because getting to the destination is a necessity.

	We need open standards
	for healthcare

	because our lives depend on it.
	Open Source (OS) Software is
	something that anyone can change and share, because it's publicly available under a generous license. While it first began with computer code, open source now influences how projects and businesses work, and our lives benefit from this open sharing. Open source has grown into a way of participating with many others that asks for transparency, community-based collaboration, and meritocracy. The best ideas float to the top, and you earn trust by what you do and how you amplify the group.

	Our internet is infused with open source ideas and services — from how cell phones communicate, to how e-mail is directed from one person to the next, to Linux. All of these technologies working together are the operating system of the internet.

	Here in the US, healthcare is
	sometimes amazing,
	often lifesaving,
	always expensive,
	and mostly closed.

	It's tribal at its core — each hospital, each doc, each healthcare system invents its own way —to the detriment of our collective health.
	
11. [Inspired EHRs: Designing for Clinicians](http://inspiredehrs.org/) The goal in writing this ebook is to inspire useful and usable Electronic Health Record (EHR) interface design by providing clinical scenarios and insights with examples of interactive designs, guided by basic design principles.
12. [Goinov](https://www.goinvo.com/work/?category=open-source) We live in a closed healthcare system.
		The algorithms that drive our care, to our clinical and life data, to hospital and treatment pricing, are governed by blackbox services.

	By using these closed systems, we are actively designed out of the decision-making process, in favor of corporate “optimized care” for optimized returns (vs optimized health outcomes).

	The biases built into software, implemented with intent or accidentally, need interrogation, citizen collaboration, and correction.

	It’s our health.

	Our very lives are at stake.

	We demand that our healthcare services be open.
	1. to inspect and correct bias,
	2. to be accessible for rapid innovation and evolution,
	3. and to become more valuable as more patients, clinicians, clinics, companies, and governments engage in healthcare for all.
13. [MITRE](https://www.mitre.org/publication-keywords/public-health) At MITRE, we solve problems for a safer world. Through our federally funded R&D centers and public-private partnerships, we work across government to tackle challenges to the safety, stability, and well-being of our nation.
14. [Flux notes](https://fluxnotes.org/) One of the best inspiring projects to design medical records. It has a unique view of how the medical record notes should be designed. Read the whole design story of [Flux notes](https://edchoi.com/project_fluxnotes.html).
